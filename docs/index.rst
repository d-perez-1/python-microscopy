PYME's Documentation
####################

This is the documentation for the python-microscopy environment, set of tools for optical microscopy, and in particular
localization - based super-resolution microscopy.

This documentation is currently very much a work in progress and is far from being complete. The API documentation, in
particular could use a lot of work. Hopefully it's enough to get you started.
